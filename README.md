# week2-assignment-image-gallery

week2 assignment. we are building an image gallery

Please also provide an assignment reflection in your project README.md file.

Required

🎯 What requirements did you achieve?

    🎯 Implement responsive design using media queries to ensure the website works well on both small mobile screens and larger desktop screens (e.g., above 800px).

    I did this and also added in touch guestures for mobile devices

    🎯 Ensure all images have appropriate alt text attributes for accessibility.
    done using alt and Aria


    🎯 Correctly use event handlers to switch images based on user interactions.

    done, i made use of button clicks, keyboard arrows and touch swipes to scroll through images

    🏹 Use 'srcset' to specify which image will be used based on the size of the screen for optimal viewing experience.
    didnt try this on Mannys suggestion


    🏹 Add ARIA elements to improve accessibility, such as aria-label, aria-live, and other relevant attributes.
    done


    🏹 Implement key bindings for buttons to enhance navigation, such as using arrow keys to switch between images.
    done


    🏹 Develop media queries for multiple screen sizes.
    done. I also tweaked so that when you turn your mobile to landscape it adjusts appropriately

🎯 Were there any requirements or goals that you were unable to achieve?

No

🎯 If so, what was it that you found difficult about these tasks? Optional 🏹 Feel free to add any other reflections you would like to share about your submission, for example:

Manny gave a lot of notes for us to follow. I didnt understand how to implement a foreach loop on the array and decided to do things with a regular for loop. I also had a lot of trouble with the index, which was used for scrolling right and left. I tried a lot of unnecesarily complicated methods that didnt quite work and finally settled on a simple solution. I could probably have been even simpler! FOr example i added an index property to our images array which was likely not needed. I left it in my code anyway for you to observe

I also had minor issues with formatting, a lot of which were fixed by
@import url("https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/jgthms/minireset.css@master/minireset.min.css");

I could have spent more time fine tuning the media queries but i didn't have time

Requesting feedback about a specific part of your submission.

I left notes in the relevant parts of my code where they were used

-What errors or bugs did you encounter while completing your assignment?
lots of errors when trying to get my index to work correctly.

How did you solve them?
I used console logs extensively throughout my code to debug it

-What went really well

I like that i got my javascript to work well, in a slightly different way to Mannys notes. I'd love to see an explanation of Mannys method and what other students tried

My lighthouse scores were really good suprisingly too!

what could have gone better?

More time on media queries and fine tuning my styling. I used css grid, is that recomended here?
